# Week 2 report

Hours spent: 10

##  What have you done this week?



I was unable to get Java testing working properly and struggled with this the entire week. So the focus, was on the actual implementation of the algorithms.
This is primarily the reason, why the coverage of the tests are so low, as I've managed to get it working only on Saturday. 

I was able to make a very crude, but working implementation of both Huffman and LZW. Unfortunately for LZW, the encoding always excludes the very last character. 

 

##  What did you learn this week / today?

Managed to understand the principles behind the two algorithms as well as implement them. 

I also learned that I should not hesitate to contact the teacher whenever I encounter problems with configurations as this has been huge time sink for me to debug myself. 

##  What has been unclear or problematic? Please answer this question truthfully, as this is something the course assistant may be able to help with.

As previously stated, getting Java testing to work properly. This has luckily been resolved. 

##  What next?

- Fix LZW encoding to include also the last character. 
- Write Unit tests to cover all the methods for both algorithms. 
- Implement a file reader for both algorithms in order to include very large text files (I'm thinking of one that is 1 KB and one 10 MB)
