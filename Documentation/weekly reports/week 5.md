# Week 4 report

Hours spent: 4

##  What have you done this week?

- Made good progress on Performance benchmark
- Made a peer review
- Updated testing and implementation documents
- Started implementing serialization for the node tree from Huffman encoding

##  What did you learn this week / today?

- I was fortunate enough to receive excellent feedback on my projects.
- Extract method structure for my methods. 
- I've realized the need to implement a serialization and deserialization for the resulting node tree from Huffman encoding. 
- File output and inputs
- Serialization of Node trees and objects in general in Java

##  What has been unclear or problematic? Please answer this question truthfully, as this is something the course assistant may be able to help with.

- Serializing the Node tree. It's not handling the null values for the Nodes properly and only results in NullPointerExceptions

##  What next?

- Make serialization and deserialization methods
- Reduce the length of the methods
- Start implementing JavaDoc
- Finish writing Unit tests to cover all the methods for both algorithms. 
- Begin testing for time taken to execute for both algorithms. 
- Begin developing a UI.
