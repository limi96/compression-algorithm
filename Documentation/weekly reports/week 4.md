Hours spent: 1

##  What have you done this week?

- Started making a PerformanceBenchmark class for testing execution speeds.
- Started writing the implementation document

I was (and still am) seriously ill the whole week and was pretty much bedridden, so I couldn't focus on this project. Also, it seems 

##  What did you learn this week / today?

String formatting in Java

##  What has been unclear or problematic? Please answer this question truthfully, as this is something the course assistant may be able to help with.

Same as week 3:

It should be the same as the number of bytes of the input, but for ASCII_256.txt it returns the wrong value. 
For others, it seems to be working, although there may be more edge cases, I haven't noticed yet. 

##  What next?

Same as week 3 with the exception of starting to write the implementation document: 

- Finish writing Unit tests to cover all the methods for both algorithms. 
- Begin testing for time taken to execute for both algorithms. 
- Begin developing a UI.
