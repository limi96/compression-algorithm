# Week 1 report

Hours spent: 8

##  What have you done this week?

I started looking through several topic ideas in detail, which was very time consuming. Eventually, I decided to focus on data compression algorithms, LZW and Huffman coding. 

Other than that, I've worked on the requirements for the week 1 report. 

##  What did you learn this week / today?

Learned the basic principles of both LZW and Huffman. 

##  What has been unclear or problematic? Please answer this question truthfully, as this is something the course assistant may be able to help with.

The scope of the project, but it could be that I just need to give more time to think over it properly. 
If I face any problems, I'll contact the teacher directly. 

##  What next?

The LZW-algorithm seemed more straightforward to implement so I'll try to get it done first.  
After that I'll implement the Huffman code and start designing tests and different input files.
