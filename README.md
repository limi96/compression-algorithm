# Data structures and Algorithm lab course

This repository is for the data structures and algorithms project course for Helsinki University.

# Running the project

Make sure you run the project in the "compression-algorithm" -folder. 
If run in the algorithms folder, the absolute path could be incorrect and results in a filepath of
"/algorithms/algorithms/test_files" instead of "/algorithms/test_files" !

If this doesn't work, you can also go to the FileUtils.java file and edit 
```
File testing = new File("algorithms/test_files/" + fileName);
```
into 

```
File testing = new File("test_files/" + fileName);
```
